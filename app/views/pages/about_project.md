# About this project
--------------------

### Purpose 

This project was created to make Dr. H Fan's life a little easier each year. He had specified that he created each course page more or less by hand. The end goal of the project is to have Dr. Fan produce some JSON of what he'd like the course to include and the site will accept it and build a whole class for him. He will then have total control over what gets released and when etc.

### Features

* Courses which may have:
  * Lectures
  * Assignments
  * Examples
  * Announcements
